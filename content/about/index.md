Hello, I'm Prateek, a passionate sales professional. To me, selling is more than just a job - it's a way of life that constantly challenges me to grow and develop new skills. I believe successful sales is all about building strong client relationships, understanding needs, and providing customized solutions.

After graduating from [PES Institute of Technology](https://pes.edu), I enjoyed 4 years of working at [Magnum Networks Support Pvt Ltd](https://www.mns.in/) in sales roles with multiple responsibilities. I then explored opportunities at [Alien Technology Transfer](https://alientt.com/) as a Senior Sales Consultant, conversing with SMEs across Europe and consulting them on securing funding for their technologies.

I am currently interning with the fintech startup [Voilo](https://www.voilo.co.uk/), supporting their business development and sales teams on lead generation initiatives. This experience has allowed me to gain hands-on exposure to the goals and needs of an early-stage company.

In addition, I am pursuing my Masters in Business Administration at [Aston University](https://www.aston.ac.uk/). With my ongoing internship experience coupled with over 4 years in sales roles, I am actively searching for full-time opportunities to apply my passions for business development, marketing, and client relations.

Here are a few things I've been working with recently:
