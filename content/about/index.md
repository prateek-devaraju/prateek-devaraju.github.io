Hello! I'm Prateek, A Sales & Marketing leader with a passion for people development, identifying & solving problems, creating & optimizing processes, based in Birmingham, UK.

I love being creative and enjoy talking to new people and learning about new technologies.

After graduating from [PES Institute of Technology](https://pes.edu), I have enjoyed 4 years of working at [Magnum Networks Support Pvt Ltd](https://www.mns.in/) with multiple responsibilities.
