Hello, I'm Prateek, a passionate sales professional with a focus on technology and SaaS solutions. To me, selling is more than just a job - it's a way of life that constantly challenges me to grow and develop new skills. I believe successful sales is all about building strong client relationships, understanding needs, and providing customized solutions.

After graduating from [PES Institute of Technology](https://pes.edu), I enjoyed 4 years of working at [Magnum Networks Support Pvt Ltd](https://www.mns.in/) in sales roles with multiple responsibilities. I then explored opportunities at [Alien Technology Transfer](https://alientt.com/) as a Senior Sales Consultant, conversing with SMEs across Europe and consulting them on securing funding for their technologies.

Currently, I am an Account Manager at [The Data City](https://thedatacity.com), a leading SaaS company, where I drive business growth through strategic client relationships and innovative data analytics solutions. This role allows me to combine my sales expertise with cutting-edge technology to deliver value to enterprise clients.

In addition, I am pursuing my Masters in Business Administration at [Aston University](https://www.aston.ac.uk/). With my extensive experience in sales roles and current position in the SaaS industry, I am continuously developing my expertise in business development, client relations, and data-driven solutions.

Here are a few things I've been working with recently:
