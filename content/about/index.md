I believe that successful selling is all about building strong relationships with clients, understanding their needs and providing them with customized solutions that meet their unique business goals. With over a decade of experience in sales and a proven track record of exceeding targets, I am confident in my ability to help businesses achieve their sales objectives and unlock their full potential. 

After graduating from [PES Institute of Technology](https://pes.edu), I have enjoyed 4 years of working at [Magnum Networks Support Pvt Ltd](https://www.mns.in/) with multiple responsibilities.

Currently, I am pursuing my Masters in Business Adminstration at [Aston University](https://www.aston.ac.uk/) and am actively looking for internship roles in the field of Sales and Marketing.
