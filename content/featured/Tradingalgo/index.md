As a Senior Sales consultant at Alien Technology Transfer, I had the privilege of working with Ntention, a cutting-edge technology company founded by Magnus and Moina. From the outset, I knew that this was a high-stakes deal that required careful negotiation and a deep understanding of their business needs. Despite facing multiple rejections and obstacles along the way, I persisted in building a strong relationship with the Ntention team and tailoring our solutions to meet their specific requirements.

Finally, after weeks of back-and-forth discussions and collaborative efforts, we closed the deal, and it was a moment of immense satisfaction for both me and the Alien team. We had not only secured a valuable partnership but had also forged a lasting friendship with the Ntention team.

To commemorate this achievement, the collaborative picture of us was posted on both Alien and Ntention's LinkedIn pages, showcasing the strong relationship we had built and the successful partnership we had forged.

Reflecting on this experience, I am reminded that in sales, success is not just about closing the deal but also about building genuine relationships with clients and understanding their unique needs. Despite facing numerous rejections, I persevered in finding the right solutions for Ntention, and my efforts paid off in the end.

I am grateful for the opportunity to work with Magnus and Moina and to be a part of their journey towards tech innovation. Their vision and passion are truly inspiring, and I look forward to watching their continued success in the years to come.
